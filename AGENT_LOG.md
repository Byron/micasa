# Agent Log

## 2026-02-05 Session

**Context**: Previous agent left build broken due to field/method name collision in `logState` (both `matches` field and `matches` method). Fixed by renaming method to `matchLine` and field to `highlights`.

**State of remaining_work.md**: Multiple tasks listed. See git log for commit history from prior sessions. Will now work through remaining tasks.

**Codebase**: Bubbletea TUI for home project/maintenance management. Has house profile, projects, quotes, maintenance tabs with forms, search, and log pane. Data layer uses GORM+SQLite.
